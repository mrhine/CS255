Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was designed for a client aiming to address a problem in drivers' education. This issue was based on the gap between drivers' education and the drivers' test pass rate. By providing additional testing and on-the-road practice, DriverPass hopes to play a vital role in bridging this gap.

What did you do particularly well?
One of the things I did particularly well was identifying functional requirements and building UML Diagrams to represent the system. These elements are crucial for concretely influencing the system's development and ensuring it meets the client's needs.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one part of my work on these documents, it would be the inclusion of the relationship between the students, drivers, and cars. We didn't address this early enough in the system, which could have improved our overall design. I also still think there is room for improvement on the relationship between our system and the DMV updates, how this relationship actually tracks the DMV for updates or alerts is still unknown.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by focusing on how the system would help customers view the materials. The user prioritized this aspect and placed less emphasis on other factors, such as the system from the drivers' perspective or the cost of the system. Understanding the user's priorities is essential for creating a system that meets their expectations and provides value.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Throughout this course, we gradually expanded our views of the system, each level of detail leading to deeper questions about the system's needs, elements, and interactions. This technique of iterative exploration helped us to design systems that reflect the client's needs. In the future, I plan to use this strategy to continue analyzing and designing effective systems.
